  Idk what I'm going to do, I feel so empty and I feel like I'm overreacting, but I can't help it. I need to start doing coding again but I don't even have the 
motivation to read text. I just can't function and I feel crazy that everyone else thinks I'm crazy... I just loved and felt something for once, that's it... right?
I can't sleep but I want to, but I don't want to wake up. Long sleep. Very.
