  I'm just so done... not with coding but with everything else. I did it to myself and I as much as I hate to say, I can't do -
  
  50%+ finished with C++ course, just been lazy, gonna grind more in coding and lay back on games. It's so dull to play now, solo queue isn't the best. Also got a way
to get a work permit, finally after months.
