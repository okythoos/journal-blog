  I already fucked up, I wrote a lot and just deleted it by accident by not saving the changes. I'm just dumb lmao, going to rewrite as much as I can.
  
  I just don't know what to do, she has needs I can't fill. I know that, but I'm trying my best and it's like she's not even trying. It's just so tiring, it used to be 
simple but just yeah... Thinking of just dark stuff at this point. I just seem to keep messing up but I don't even know what's happening most of the time, she doesn't
tell me anything anymore and it seems like I'm just a drag. Just going to assume the worse and follow suit. I don't even know what I did, she keeps bringing stuff up
from the past that I messed up even though I've changed, I know she has every right to, but I'm trying to change for the better and I feel like bringing up the bad stuff
from the past while the person is trying to change for good doesn't help much. They don't accept that type of stuff I guess. I really just want to leave, but in the same
time I don't want to. It's weird. I even told her about how I'm feeling and what's been on my mind and she just blows it off, I'm telling you this stuff because I want 
both of us to go back to the good days, not even that but just to do simple things, like update each other and just not be dry. She just responds with "yeah". I would
do anything to make her feel better, for example if she was getting jealous of someone I met I would do anything just to make her feel comfortable, I remember only one
thing that I didn't do and that was just being around her when there was someone I didn't want to be around, they were a friend of hers and I respect that If 
she wants to hangout with them, but just don't expect me to be there in the same time, I would be there after and before but not in the same room. I even made a new 
place so we can just talk but she invited him into it too, and I know I said yes to it but what else am I going to say, she knows how uncomfortable I am around him, 
just why. It also doesn't feel good when they do stuff we do, like late night calls and just talking privately while in vc. Just doesn't feel good at all... I don't 
know what to think. Because it can go both ways, we can both do things to avoid problems when we get mad its just, we expect each other to do stuff, but when 
neither of us do we just fall further apart. I want to talk and stuff, when I'm in the same room with both of them I'm usually just not there practically, like deafened 
or muted, and when she asks me to unmute or undeafen then I do, for like the entire time I'm listening and just there finally, nothing happens, she just says "hi" and 
I say "hi" back but there's already a conversation I'm not apart of or just they're playing without me. It just doesn't seem cool, or like yeah. I'm not sure what to 
do. And texts don't even. I feel like she's only dry with me too, she laughs and giggles with other friends while I'm just here wondering what I did wrong this time 
and I just feel so tired all of a sudden. She just gets upset when I bring it up too, well, it can go either way. She would either be upset or just feel nothing for 
me. I really whish she was just... no. If I wish she was different that wouldn't make me feel good, I just want to die honestly, like truly lmao. T-T. I just thought 
she was my anchor but if anything right now she's making me more lost than before. fuck... im a loser. im a loser thinking someone can wait for a guy like me lmao, 
that someone can understand where im coming from, i know ive done stuff i regret today but i wish you just didnt see my mistakes and talked about other stuff with me.
I just feel so unloved now, the first time I really felt it and it took one stupid decision by someone else to fuck it up. I would do anything to try to make her feel
better, but it's just so complicated now. It feels like she doesn't even want to talk to me. I'll just stay lost for now, I'll just keep going for now.

  // This might be hard to read and I'm sorry, it was long and I had to copy it pretty much because I deleted it by accident the first time.
  
  Going to continue coding C++, I'll update how much progress I've made in the lesson adn explain what I've learned. So far on the topic of Conditions, if statements,
etc.
