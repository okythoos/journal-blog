  Having trouble with if, else, and if else statements... might have to come back to it later, I get the concept, I just don't know how to exactly apply it to code. Well
kinda but just having trouble -

  Nevermind, got the hang of it, in this problem I had to find out if a pH variable was acidic, basic, or neutral. 
 
 
 - The question -
 
 In chemistry, pH is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution.

Write an if, else if, else statement that:

If ph is greater than 7, output “Basic”.
If ph is less than 7, output “Acidic”.
If neither, output “Neutral”.
