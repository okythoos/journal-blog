  Having trouble with if, else, and if else statements... might have to come back to it later, I get the concept, I just don't know how to exactly apply it to code. Well
kinda but just having trouble -

  Nevermind, got the hang of it, in this problem I had to find out if a pH variable was acidic, basic, or neutral. 
 
 
 - The question -
 
 In chemistry, pH is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution.

Write an if, else if, else statement that:

If ph is greater than 7, output “Basic”.
If ph is less than 7, output “Acidic”.
If neither, output “Neutral”.


- code -

  So got this question right with only a few lings of code.
  
int main() {
  
  double ph = 4.6;
  
  
 if (ph > 7) {

   std::cout << "Basic\n";

 }

 else if (ph < 7) {


std::cout << "Acidic\n";

 }

 else {

   std::cout << "Neutral\n";

 }
 
 
  Going to start do my driving lessons too so eventually I can drive by myself, also going to start my work permit so I can get a summer job, even though summer is like
half over already.
