  Idk what I'm going to do, I feel so empty and I feel like I'm overreacting, but I can't help it. I need to start doing coding again but I don't even have the 
motivation to read text. I just can't function and I feel crazy that everyone else thinks I'm crazy... I just loved and felt something for once, that's it... right? It
wasn't that easy getting over and somehow you did but I guess we just think differently, and valued each other differently.
I can't sleep but I want to, but I don't want to wake up. Long sleep. Very.

  So I found out the date titles for each file won't work, it'll mess up the organization of it so I'll jsut stick to this file. I took a break from coding and everything
because of everything happening right now. I resumed a day ago. I also finished my drivers ed class so when the certificate arrives I'll take the dmv test. I'll keep
updating, cya next time.
