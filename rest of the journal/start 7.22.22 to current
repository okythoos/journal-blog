  Idk what I'm going to do, I feel so empty and I feel like I'm overreacting, but I can't help it. I need to start doing coding again but I don't even have the 
motivation to read text. I just can't function and I feel crazy that everyone else thinks I'm crazy... I just loved and felt something for once, that's it... right? It
wasn't that easy getting over and somehow you did but I guess we just think differently, and valued each other differently.
I can't sleep but I want to, but I don't want to wake up. Long sleep. Very.

  So I found out the date titles for each file won't work, it'll mess up the organization of it so I'll jsut stick to this file. I took a break from coding and everything
because of everything happening right now. I resumed a day ago. I also finished my drivers ed class so when the certificate arrives I'll take the dmv test. I'll keep
updating, cya next time.

  It's been awhile since I wrote in this so I'll try to get everything covered at once. Mentally and emotionally doing better. . Still hurts but it's probably going to 
hurt for the remainder of my life no matter what, I was serious when I said they were the one, but anyways, got into physical school finally. For two years I've been
doing virtual school and honestly I don't regret it, it was a nice period of time where I really got to explore myself and find something that I really liked doing, 
although I'm not a master yet I'm trying to code, I'm going to be honest when I say I haven't learned a lot since my last journaling but I'm getting there now, I've
gotten the urge to reset my past progression and get into coding. I'm going to learn duel Codecademy courses and CS50 on EdX, I'm not sure if CS50 online will count
on college applications but it'll definitely help me as a person and progression towards my coding career. In my new school of Roybal High I'm taking three AP courses
(English Lit, Gov, Comp Sci) and a precalc class. Nothing too impressive but these are the best classes I can take considering I was out of school for two years and all 
I took were basic core classes. In computer science we are using Replit and Python, so far we've only coded two simple projects consisting of loops, conditions, and a
multitude of basic variables, but it's only the frist two weeks so I don't expect much. I'm not sure why we have only 4 courses but I'll figure out sooner or later. 
I've also joined the Debate Club to progress my social speaking skills, it was the only club I could find too, but that's besides the point... I've found a steady 
schedule so far and even a super cool friend group that doesn't seem back stabby. I'm actually having fun in a game I'm not 'good' at.

  On my time away from code I've been working out pretty consistently, at a minimum of an hour and a half a day for five days a week. I've taken a yearly physical and
it shows I'm 5'9 and 120 lbs which is astounding to me, I always thought I was lighter than that but I guess I had a broken measure device. During my workouts I try to
spread the activity throughout my body but I always do chest, at least a little per workout. I have always been pretty insecure about my pigeon chest so that's going 
on. Well I'll be more active on this, I promise this time, my next, new coding goal is to make a website purely for my blog here so I don't have to keep using GitHub.
Not that it's bad or anything but it's not mean't for this, so I'll try to create a more comfortable place to write.

  Right now it's 2:03 am, I can't sleep, I hate being alone... I've made new friends though in school, didn't have to do anything and they just invited me to hangout
at Little Tokyo, feels good but it doesn't help everything. Classes have been pretty easy so far and I'm assigned an SAT seat in November, I made a schedule for 
practice tests and studying but I'm not sure how that's going to go, I'll try. From my recent physical I discovered I was 120 lb, 5'9, I was kind've shocked honestly
but I made a goal for me, 3,000+ calories a day since I'm working out practically everyday. I'm still hopeful I'll grow taller, my nurse of a mother said I would, I
have tall cousins, uncles, and etc, there's definitely a chance, but I'm going to try to sleep more and eat more... sleeping isn't as much of a problem as before but
I still feel tired after an 8 hour sleep, I don't know what to do, I wake up and I don't try to go back to sleep, I can't, it hurts. It's been awhile but I haven't 
forgotten, it may seem like I forgot but I haven't, everything reminds me of you and I hate it. Few days ago there were two school officials talking about mental 
health and relationships, I stayed quiet the rest of the day, it's like ptsd to me, I just physically can't, that whole day I wore my hood on because I felt safe,
felt good. I haven't forgotten you and everything but I did lose hints of what you look like, of what you sound like, smell and everything. I'm not sure if this
is better for me or not but one thing I know for sure is, if I keep thinking about her the same and if I keep failing I'm going to ruin myself even more. I hate...
You can finish that yourself if you want.

  It's the middle of the night, around 1:30 am so I guess it's the 8th, I can't sleep. For awhile I've been waking up with tears and dried up eyes, I think it's from
crying while sleeping, I'm not entirely sure but I'm not sure what else it can be, the weather has been pretty mediocre. I'll update this later today I promise,
going to catch up after my volounteering and discuss the prgression on my website and school. Oh and also to label some things for my ambitions list... Ye.

Cont.
